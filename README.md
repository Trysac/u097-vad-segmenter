Pure-Python adaptive energy-based voice activity detection that turns streamed audio samples into speech segments for live transcription

## Problem

Describe in two or three sentences the concrete problem this utility solves, who hits it, and what
they do today without it. Replace this paragraph when the first real feature lands.

## Install

```sh
pip install trysac-vad-segmenter
# or
uv add trysac-vad-segmenter
```

Requires Python 3.10 or newer. No runtime dependencies.

## Usage

```python
import vad_segmenter

# normalize() trims surrounding whitespace and lower-cases the text.
print(vad_segmenter.normalize("  Hello World "))  # -> "hello world"

# Blank input is rejected explicitly instead of returning an empty string.
try:
    vad_segmenter.normalize("   ")
except ValueError as exc:
    print(f"rejected: {exc}")
```
